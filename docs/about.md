# About

I'm an experienced Full Stack Developer with a background in fast-paced agency environments. I'm driven by opportunities to learn from exceptional people and solve complex problems. I thrive on crafting beautiful, accessible user experiences and bringing ideas to life. Outside of work, I enjoy live music, exploring the outdoors, and experimenting with new programming tools and languages.
